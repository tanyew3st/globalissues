								<p>	The Digital Divide is the growing spread in countries’ ability to provide their citizens with technology.  Providing the infrastructure for technology is seen in both developed and undeveloped countries, but it is most prominent in the many developing, third-world countries who currently struggle to provide their citizens with basic technological needs. In developing countries, it is important to push the government to increase spending in all aspects of technological development, as, in most cases, the majority of citizens do not have the access to technology. </p>

								<p>For example, the most underdeveloped continent, technologically, is Africa. In most African countries, less than ten percent of citizens have access to a computer1. The geography of the region is important because, for example, Africa’s convenient location led to the easy colonization by Europeans. After countries in Africa gained their freedom, many were left undeveloped as their main provider of funds and resources – their colonizers – had left. In addition to Africa, India went through something very similar, where, after the British left, they suffered greatly and are currently unable to provide technology to their citizens. Hence, the biggest regions in which this world is a problem is central and northern Africa, the Indian Subcontinent, and other regions that relied heavily on their colonizers.</p>
								<p>	Geography affects this global issue because, integration wise, the economies of third-world countries are very unstable and undeveloped. Therefore, they are not able to properly provide their money and infrastructure to give their citizens technology. Additionally, culturally, governments such as India and many African governments have been falsely convinced that food, water, etc. are more important than technological integration and growth. However, due to the economies of these countries, it is equally beneficial to give their citizens the access to technology through education to foster and develop a more powerful next generation. </p>
								<p>In third-world nations such as India and countries in (central and northern) Africa, jobs involving technology are rising as these nations are attempting to compete with more developed countries. Hence, when nations are not able to educate their citizens in technology, they cannot foster a community that is able to keep up with the growing outside influence.</p>
								<p>	I will focus on Kenya, India, and Colombia because these regions have the most available information published while still being undeveloped. Kenya has been very technologically underdeveloped after their decolonization because their government focused its spending on giving citizens food, water, etc. Likewise, India has been lacking technologically because of the large population and the government’s inability to provide proper education in technology. Since the more newly-elected prime minister, reform has been very popular within India; hence, it will be beneficial to focus on India because I can analyze the patterns of development and see how the new prime minister is taking action and acting upon the flaws in education and the digital divide. </p>
								<p>Lastly, I am focusing on Colombia because the government has recently claimed that they will provide “63% of the population with internet by 2018” (Columbia Reports). With this very current figure, I will be able to easily analyze the motives behind Colombia’s interest in providing their citizens with technology, and I can see how the government is most efficiently resolving the problem regarding the global digital divide.  </p>

								<p>History of the Global Issue: The history of technology being prominent today has reached back until the decolonization of colonies. During the time of colonization, although controlling the free-will of many of their colonies, colonizers such as Great Britain, France, etc. provided opportunity and recent technology that they had. Because of this, countries weren’t defined by the development of their countries, but rather, all countries were defined by the development of their colonizer. However, after countries broke out of their ‘spheres of influence,’ they were defined by their own development, which lacked due to the lack of funding and inorganization in their government. During the late 20th century, and into the early 21st century, technology has seen a lot of growth as technology continues to grow and be redefined. Because of the constant discovery within the field of technology in the early 21st century, it is essential for the new generation to be educated digitally.  </p>
								<p>When did this become a Global Issue: Digital literacy became a global issue once more advanced countries started to take advantage of the new digital age, (notably after decolonization) and thus, left developing, less democratic nations behind the information age. Once nations had a way to reach others around the world, it became essential for their citizens. The newly-created internet age makes it essential for kids to be educated in the field of technology as children to be able to live in the next generation, likely powered by modern technology. However, nations that have not been able to provide technology for their citizens in the late 20th century are still suffering the same problem, for, their citizens are undereducated in essential tools and cannot prepare the next generations to bridge the “digital divide.” In the late 19th century, developing countries made initiatives to augment the access to technology; for example, the United States passed the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991. However, these initiatives generally impact more democratic nations and are very difficult when nations evaluate the cost of technology over the more directly viewed problems such as food, water, security, etc.</p>
								<p>What makes this a Global Issue: Because of the disproportionate development of technology, citizens are deprived of their ability to access the internet and gain essential information for their development. Since the world is moving with respect to the growth of technology, a citizen is considered behind if they do not have the more current needs, inclusive of technology. Accessing technology is important because accessing the full potential of citizens and nations requires an education, a global understanding, and digital literacy, all of which can be accomplished by giving citizens the access to technology. Eventually, without digital literacy, nations have fallen behind in education, labor, and tourism. Because of this, the term “digital divide” is used to describe the ends of the spectrums between tech filled and thus, developed nations, and more archaic nations. In addition, a solution is not easily presented, for technology is very expensive, making it very hard for foreign countries to provide developing and less democratic nations with modern tech. Therefore, many developing nations are struggling to provide technology to their citizens without increasing their debt, and thus, cannot bridge the “digital divide.”   </p>

								<p>	Diego Molano, former minister of information technology in Colombia, said that “there is a very strong correlation between internet penetration and reduction of poverty. I see that every day” (Colombia Reports). Internet penetration is the percentage of the total population that uses the internet, so Molano is saying that the growing rates of internet usage are seen in Colombia to help reduce poverty. For example, Burundi and Sierra Leone, having 64.6 and 70.2 percent*, respectively, under the poverty line, have internet penetration rates of 1.1 and 0.3 percent, respectively. In comparison with Canada, who has 9.4 percent under the poverty line and an internet penetration rate of 82.7 percent, these countries have an infinitesimal number of internet users and the data suggests that there is a direct correlation between internet penetration and poverty. Although technology does not directly fix poverty, the access to technology is becoming essential in everyday lives of developing countries for job seeking, communication, health care, trade, and staying current with the world. Unfortunately, while many people can access the internet with the click of a mouse, most people do not have the ability to easily connect themselves. However, as countries are becoming more educated surrounding the disguised side-effects of being unconnected, governments are trying hard to find ways to integrate technology. </p>
								<p>	Impressively, the access to technology is being acted on in many developing countries, such as Somalia and Colombia; however, countries like India are still struggling to initiate their technological development. The current initiatives of Colombia and Somalia include empowering youth and providing government aid. For example, in Colombia, the first Latin American country to be connected to the internet, a program called “Vive Digítal,” or “Live Digitally” was recently implemented throughout their nation. In this program, modern-day technology was given to citizens using kiosks. Starting from a nation with very little electricity, the pure drive to add technology helped make this a reality. “Vive Digital” aims to empower youth by giving “boys and girls a head start to start familiarizing themselves with technology” (Colombia Head of State, Colombia Reports). Due to the large reforms, Colombia is rapidly rising in the amount of internet users, currently at 56.9 percent. There is a clear initiative taken by the government, for the percentage of internet users has doubled in the last five years, with the rate of growth continuously rising. In addition to Colombia, though taking a different approach, Somalia is also increasing efforts of providing kids with technology. Currently, Somalia has an internet penetration rate of 1.2 percent. Somalia recently announced iHub: a program where Somalian kids come up with technologically innovative ideas to contribute to their society and receive funding and guidance by experienced entrepreneurs. Due to the wars fought in the country, the majority of the Somalian population are children (62.19 percent under the age of 24); Hence, empowering future generations by providing technology and educating children is the best way to move the Somalian economy forwards and stay connected. Both “Vive Digital” and iHub aim to empower youth in hopes that their citizens will be better be participants in society as adults. </p>
								<p>	While there are solutions that are being implemented in Somalia and Colombia, larger countries like India are struggling to provide their citizens with technology. India is home to some of the larges IT startups and companies, yet a staggering nine-hundred million people do not have access to technology. The current status of connectivity provides difficult circumstances – India lacks routers and technological fibers to bring the easy integration of technology. Thus, this creates a large gap between the haves and have-nots. Additionally, other pressures like gender play a role. “One woman that interviewed as part of the CCDS (Center for communications and development studies) study said that people in her neighborhood don’t like to see girls using mobile phones because it ‘does not look good’” (CNN tech, Huizhong Wu). In the example of India, societal pressure, the large population, and the lack of infrastructure are making it difficult for the government to provide technological aid to citizens. For such a large population, such as a country like India, it is especially important for India to at least start making large initiatives and allocating part of the national budget solely towards the integration of technology.</p>
								<p>	Technology is being implemented in governments that most want it; while the concept of accessing technology can be abstract to many governing bodies, those who begin the process of integrating technology can often see the prosperity of a technological nation in just a few decades. While Colombia and Somalia are strengthening their own economy, they are also empowering other Latin American and African (respectively) nations to provide the access to technology in their nation. Once connected, the benefits are endless. For example, in these countries, due to global pressures, technology-based jobs have become plentiful as they best provide to the modern needs of their employers. However, due to the lack of digitally literate citizens, these jobs go unoccupied, thus unable to perform the technological function of the job. Creating a domino effect, the technology lost in that job never goes back to add value to the society in order to make that particular country one step closer to being digital. Having similar effects in education and trade, digitally illiterate citizens make it very difficult for nations to keep up on a global scale and keep their country connected. </p>
