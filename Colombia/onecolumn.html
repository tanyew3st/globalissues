								<h2>"Vive Digital"</h2>
								<p>Vive Digital is Colombia's name for their plan to get 27 million or (63 percent of the population) connected. Already, beginning in 2010, Colombia's Live Digital Plan, as it's called in English, has already brought up the connectivity from 2.2 million to 8.8 million (Colombia Reports). Still, the nation plans to increase that number <strong>three times itself</strong> in the next year. Basically, 80 out of 100 Colombians will have access to the internet in some way. This projected figure will bring the nation's internet penetration (amount of people using the internet) up to that of <strong>Belgium</strong></p>
								<p>Colombia is said to be using 'bleeding edge technology,' technology that even the United States would be happy to have. Already, this project has helped bridge the gap between the rich and the poor. To be able to do this, Colombia has teamed up with different companies that believe in their initiative. One of those companies, Hughes, is helping by installing and operating more than 1,500 Vive Digital Kiosks across the country (hughes.com). With their initiative, they believe that they are empowering youth and enriching the lives of schoolchildren in rural and remote parts of Colombia. With these advancements, tech company hopes that the access to Internet service can dramatically change the lives of Colombian citizens and help them survive in the demanding-21st century.</p>
								<p>However, there is nothing without drawbacks; a decent amount of the country does not have access to electricity, so it is extremely difficult to give them the access to technology. For example, one employee of Vive Digital has said that many computers delivered to schools and communities have gone unused due to the lack of electricity. The only alternative is a generator, and, of course, these provide their own problem. They are often expensive to operate and are used sparingly.</p>
