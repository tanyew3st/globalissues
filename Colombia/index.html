								<h2>Here is what is happening in Colombia</h2>
								<p>Colombia has really struggled in the past to provide to their citizens.
									Recently, the government has promised that they will rise to a high internet penetration rate of 68%.
									 Colombia has struggled with drugs and many local problems, so this is a string sign of development in the right direction.</p>

										<a href="#"><img src="images\Poverty_in_Colombia_by_Luis_Perez.jpg" alt="" class="left" /></a>
										<h3>Main Objective</h3>
										<p>“The main objective we have in Colombia is using technology and ICT
											 [information and communications technology] to solve the most important problem in Colombia – and that problem is poverty,”
											 stated Colombia’s Minister for Information and Communication Technology,
											  Diego Molano, in a March interview with the Washington Post.</p>

										<h3>Effects</h3>
										<p>“Three and a half years ago, when this government started, more than 38% of Colombians were living under the poverty line.
											 The government has focused on helping people to leapfrog. We’ve taken 2.5 million people out of poverty in just three years”
											 and “There is a very strong correlation between Internet penetration and the reduction of poverty. I see
											 that every day,” said Diego Molano to the Washington Post.
											 “When we connect, for example, a rural school to Internet, when w
											 e connect a small school in the middle of the jungle to Internet, those kids in the middle of nowhere have effectively the same opportunity to access the whole of information society — just like any kid in New York, London or Paris.”</p>

										<h3>Partners</h3>
										<p>After partnering with Hughes, Hughes said, “Bringing the educational and econ
											omic advantages of the Internet to rural and underserved populations is an imp
											ortant mission of the Hughes international business,” said Hugo Frega, Hughes senior director of sales, Latin America. “We are proud to be working with both Anditel and Hispasat (Colombian governmental figures) as new Hughes custom
											ers and highly experienced partners in connecting the most remote places in Colombia.”</p>

								<h3>Magna Gravida Dolore</h3>
								<p>Vive Digital is Colombia's name for their plan to get 27 million or (63 percent of the population) connected. Already, beginning in 2010, Colombia's Live Digital Plan, as it's called in English, has already brought up the connectivity from 2.2 million to 8.8 million (Colombia Reports). Still, the nation plans to increase that number <strong>three times itself</strong> in the next year. Basically, 80 out of 100 Colombians will have access to the internet in some way. This projected figure will bring the nation's internet penetration (amount of people using the internet) up to that of <strong>Belgium</strong></p>
