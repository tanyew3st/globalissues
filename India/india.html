    <h1>Welcome To India!</h1>
    <p id="dynamic-content"><!--India claims that it has some of the best tech and IT companies in the world! Yet, according to Pew Research Center, only 22% of adults in India have access to the internet. Additionally, out of the total population, according to World Bank, 10.1 percent of the population have access to the internet. Why is this?
      <ul>
        <li>Well, India simply lacks the infrastructure to provide to such a big population - fiber optic links and servers needed to expand are very hard to implement and are quite scarce.</li>
        <li>Affordibility: Accessing the internet is not as cheap as America makes it. Adding to that is the fact that 75% of India earns less than 74 dollars per month (CNN)</li>
        <li>Awareness: Many Indians lack a basic understanding of the Internet: they don't know much about it and can barely use it. The internet is learned through connections and observations. When you see others using Facebook or Twitter, etc, you learn Twitter and Facebook. But when you don't see anyone using these technologies, it's very difficult to learn. Similar to learning a new language, education in the internet is just not easy.</li>
      </ul>-->
